#  LiveGuard AI – Hackathon Prototype

## Problem Statement
In emergency situations, people often fail to get immediate help due to the absence of a real-time safety monitoring and alert system. Delays in response can lead to serious consequences.

---

##  Solution
LiveGuard AI is a **hackathon-level prototype** designed to provide a quick and reliable safety solution.  
The system detects emergency situations and automatically sends alerts to predefined contacts or authorities, ensuring faster response and support.

##  Key Features
- Emergency detection mechanism  
- Automatic alert & notification system  
- Real-time response (prototype level)  
- Simple and user-friendly interface  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** MIT App Inventor  
- **Logic / Backend:** Java / Python (as used in prototype)  
- **Automation:** WhatsApp / Notification-based alert system  
- **Platform:** Android (Prototype Application)
